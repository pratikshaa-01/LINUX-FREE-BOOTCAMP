#Adding a User with useradd:   
When a user is added using the useradd command, several system files are modified (Important for Interviews):

/etc/passwd: A new entry is added.
/etc/shadow: A new entry is created for the user’s password.
/etc/group: The user is added to a group.
/etc/gshadow: Shadow group information is updated.
/home/user: A home directory is created for the user.
/var/spool/mail/user: A mail spool for the user is created.
Skeleton Files: Default configuration files (from /etc/skel) are copied to the user’s home directory.

###What is difference between su and su-  ??   (IMP for Interview)
su only changes the identity of the user.
su - provides the full login environment with the correct shell and home directory.
