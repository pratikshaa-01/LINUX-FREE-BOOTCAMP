###Some Advanced User Administration Commands:

#usermod
Use this command to modify a user's information.

#usermod -g
Change the user's primary group.

#usermod -aG
Add the user to a secondary group. (The -a flag ensures the user is added to the group without being removed from existing ones.)

#usermod -s
Change the user's default shell.

#usermod -c
Modify the user's comment field (e.g., full name or description).

#usermod -u
Change the user's UID (User ID).

#chage
Change the password aging information.

#chage -l
List the password expiration information for a user.

###sudo (Super User Do)
#There are two methods to grant a user sudo permissions:

1.Using the Wheel Group
Add the user to the wheel group to grant sudo permissions.
Example:
usermod -aG wheel Pratiksha

2.Editing the /etc/sudoers File
You can manually add an entry to the /etc/sudoers file to grant sudo access:
ALL=(ALL) ALL

Note: It is recommended to use visudo to safely edit the /etc/sudoers file, as it checks for syntax errors before saving.
